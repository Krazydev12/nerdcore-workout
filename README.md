# Nerdout Workout
Taking to consideration the current pandemic, this app aims to motivate people who haven’t worked out before - or who have stopped working out - to start working out; listening to nostalgic video game music can be a great incentive. This webpage allows the user to pick a workout and a video game music track to workout to.

## How it works
Starting at a landing page, user is presented with description and a button to get started. They are redirected to the main page, and presented with options for a workout and music to go along with the workout. They can click a button to play the combination they chose.

GIVEN that I want to workout (and I’m a nerd)
WHEN I pick a workout routine and a piece of video game music
THEN I am given an energizing workout routine combining the two choices
